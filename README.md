CRC-8 Checksum Generator on FPGA | VHDL, FPGA Programming 
Sep. 2024 - Dec. 2024

• Designed a CRC-8 calculator in VHDL using a mix of behavioral and data flow modeling for efficient
cyclic redundancy check computation.

• Developed a comprehensive testbench to validate functionality using multiple test vectors (polynomial
and data inputs).

• Synthesized and implemented the design as a bitstream on the Artix-7 FPGA using Xilinx Vivado.

• Verified hardware-level functionality successfully through on-board testing and simulation.
